I have no to few idea about tests - i have written some during the course that i did few months ago
I thought tests are like running part of deployed application but no, i was wrong, they are only for developers and run when a person makes the pr - tests are run before code being redy to be merged with main branch.

timeline looks like this ->

You write code
   ↓
You run tests (locally)
   ↓
You push code
   ↓
CI runs tests (GitHub Actions)
   ↓
If tests pass → code can be merged
   ↓
Production build ships (NO tests included)
