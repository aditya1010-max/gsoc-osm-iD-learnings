High-Value "GSoC Level" Features for kbarTo make your proposal "attractive," 
features that the current UI hides deep in menus. 

Here are four categories of advanced shortcuts you could implement using the context API:

1.Quick-Action Geometry ToolsiD has powerful tools that are usually buried in the right-click "Operations" menu. 
Mapping these to kbar is a massive win for productivity."Orthogonalize" (Square corners): context.perform(actionOrthogonalize(ids, context.projection))"Circularize": context.perform(actionCircularize(ids, context.projection))"Reverse Way" (Direction): context.perform(actionReverse(ids))"Extract Node": For moving a node out of a way without deleting it.

2. Preset-Specific "Add" CommandsInstead of just "Add Point," imagine typing "Add Fire Hydrant".The Logic: Your kbar action would search the presetManager, find the hydrant preset, and call context.enter(modeAddPoint(context, hydrantPreset)).The Value: This skips the entire "search for tag" sidebar process.

3. Map Layer & Debug TogglesNavigating the "Map Data" sidebar is tedious. Propose kbar commands for:Toggle Wireframe Mode: Toggles the context.getDebug('wireframe').Switch Imagery: Quickly switch between Bing, Esri, or Mapbox background layers.Hide/Show Features: Quickly toggle layers like "Point of Interest" or "Service Roads."

4. Navigation & Search (The "Jump" Command)The most powerful use of a palette is moving across the map."Go to Location": Integration with a Geocoder (like Nominatim). Type "London" $\rightarrow$ context.map().centerZoom(...)."Find Entity": Type an OSM ID or a name like "Main St" $\rightarrow$ context.zoomToEntity(id).
