1️⃣ Each PR has a single clear purpose

Example progression:

PR 1:

Add kbar folder + empty scaffold (no behavior)

PR 2:

Add action registry (no UI yet)

PR 3:

Render static command list

PR 4:

Keyboard open/close logic

PR 5:

Filtering + search

Each PR:

compiles

passes CI

can be reviewed in isolation


WHY STEP BY STEP PRS?


1️⃣ You learn why files exist, not just what’s inside them

If you start with:

registry.js
palette.js
render.js
events.js


and add them one by one, you naturally ask:

Why is this logic not in index.js?

What should this file own?

What should it never know about?

That’s architectural thinking — and you cannot get it by pasting working code
