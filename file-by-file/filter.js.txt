This file contains a function- 

What this function does (high level)

👉 It filters a list of actions based on what the user types.

If the user types nothing → return everything

If the user types "add point" or even "point add" → it matches "Add Point"

Order does not matter

Every word typed must exist somewhere in the action title

This is perfect for a command palette / search bar.
