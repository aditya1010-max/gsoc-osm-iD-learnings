main things to keep in mind for applying kbar functionality in osm-iD

1. Respect iD’s mode-driven architecture

iD lives and breathes modes (browse, add-point, draw-line, etc.).

Keep in mind:

kbar actions should almost always enter a mode, not do heavy logic themselves.

Your onSelect should usually look like:

context.enter(modeAddPoint(context))


Never bypass mode logic just to “do the thing faster”.

👉 If it doesn’t map cleanly to a mode, it probably doesn’t belong in kbar.
