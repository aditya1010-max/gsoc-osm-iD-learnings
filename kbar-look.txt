Big principle first (this matters most)

kbar in iD should feel:

Invisible when you don’t need it

Obvious when you do

Never louder than the map itself

It is not a product feature.
It is a power tool.

1️⃣ Overlay (background)

Full-screen

Semi-transparent dark layer

Click outside = close

No animation-heavy blur

Why?

Focuses attention

Signals “modal mode”

Matches iD’s existing confirmation overlays

✅ Your current .kbar-overlay is correct
