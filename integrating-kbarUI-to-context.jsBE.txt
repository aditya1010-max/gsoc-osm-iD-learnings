Here is the short and meaningful explanation of the 4 steps used to integrate your KBar into context.js:

1. Import (The Connection)
JavaScript
import { kbar } from '../ui/kbar';
Meaning: This tells the context.js file where to find your code. It links the Core (backend logic) to your UI (frontend logic) so they can talk to each other.

2. Define Variable (The Storage)
JavaScript
let _kbar;
Meaning: This creates a private "container" inside the Context to hold your specific KBar instance. It ensures your KBar exists in memory but isn't accidentally overwritten by something else.

3. Expose Accessor (The Public Switch)
JavaScript
context.kbar = () => _kbar;
Meaning: This gives the rest of the application permission to talk to your KBar. By calling context.kbar(), other features can check if it exists or trigger its methods (like .open()) securely.

4. Instantiate (The Kick-off)
JavaScript
_kbar = kbar(context);
Meaning: This is the "Start Engine" moment. It runs your orchestrator.js code, which immediately sets up the Cmd+K listener on the window. Without this step, your code is imported but never actually turned on.
