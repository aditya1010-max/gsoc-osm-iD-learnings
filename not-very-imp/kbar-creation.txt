It surprised me, i though ctrl + k will build kbar every time but not it will just unhide 

- In lot of modern apps (reactor vue)
 ctrl k will create component + mount DOM and destroy on close 

- but not in iD 
beacuse iD is older, D3 based , performance-sernsitive, keyboard-heavy 

so it uses different pattern


What iD actually does 

at app startup/UI initialization 

create overlay DOM 
wire keyboard handlers
hide overlay

The overlay just sits there, invisible 

Wheen user presses ctrl + k

unhide overlay 
focus input 
populate actions 

Whwn user ccloses kbar 

hide overlay 
restore focus 

we do this -> 
overlay.classed('hidden', true);

not this -> 
overlay.remove(); and selection.append(...)



Why id does it this way (very deliberate)

1. PErformance - no DOM  churn , instant open , no layout trash 

2. Predictible focus management - input always exists, focus can be restored reliably , no race conditions

3. Simpler lifecycle - 
Instad of : create → mount → unmount → destroy
they do: show → hide





small downside -

But dosent this "waste memory" ?

Technically yes - a tiny bit

practically: 
. negligible
. far outweighed by UX stability 
. common in editors
