Why multiple small commits are good
During development

Small commits help you:

easier to undo mistakes

easier to bisect locally

easier to reason about changes

safer experimentation

Example good dev commits:

kbar: add filterActions unit tests
kbar: fix filtering source list bug
kbar: cleanup comments


Totally fine.

When commits start to matter more

Commits matter more when:

PR is large

changes are subtle

reviewer wants to follow reasoning

or you’re touching critical code

In those cases:

clean commit messages help

logical grouping helps

Squash vs keep commits?
Two common outcomes (both acceptable)
1️⃣ Squash merge (very common)

All commits become one commit on main

History is clean

Your intermediate commits don’t matter

This is how many projects (including iD) merge PRs.

2️⃣ Merge commits as-is

Commits stay separate

Requires decent commit messages

Still fine if commits are logical
