Is this file incomplete?
Short answer

Yes — intentionally incomplete.

And that’s good.

Why it’s incomplete (by design)

Right now, it only contains:

3 creation modes

1 contextual command

But the structure is already correct.

This file should grow, not be rewritten.

What registry.js should do in the long run

Over time, this becomes the central command catalog for iD.

1. Many more action types

Eventually you’ll see actions like:

Editing

Delete selection

Duplicate

Reverse way

Navigation

Zoom to selection

Jump to coordinates

Presets

Set Road

Set Building

Power-user commands

Toggle wireframe

Reload imagery

Flush cache

All of these belong here, not in UI code.

2. Richer metadata (future-proofing)

Long-term, actions will likely include:

{
  id: 'delete',
  title: 'Delete',
  subtitle: 'Remove selected features',
  icon: 'iD-icon-trash',
  shortcut: 'Del',
  section: 'Edit',
  keywords: ['remove', 'erase'],
  enabled: () => context.selectedIDs().length > 0,
  onSelect: ...
}


Your current structure already allows this.

That’s a very good sign.

3. Separation by domain (likely refactor)

Eventually, this file might split into:

registry/
  modes.js
  selection.js
  navigation.js
  presets.js
  debug.js


And registry.js would compose them.

But you should not do that yet.
Premature abstraction would hurt readability right now.
