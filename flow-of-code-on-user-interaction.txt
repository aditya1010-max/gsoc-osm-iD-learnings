The flow of single command execution happens in four steps/phases-

Phase 1: Input Detection 

1. User press Ctrl + k on keyboard 
2. events.js hears it - This file has global event listener attached to the window, which detects the keystroke combination 
3. after detection events.js tells the orchestrator.js telling user want to open kbar palette 
4. the orchestrator.js pings the lifecycle.js file to switch the state variable from isOpen: false to isOpen: true.

Phase 2: Rendering 

5. UI is mounted(from palette.js) as the state is true, the main React/DOM component in palette.js is inserted in DOM
6. Data is fetched from registry.js - as the palette opens it asks registry.js - what commands are available right now?
7. Focus is automatically shifted to input field inside palette.js so the user can type immediately.

Phase 3: Searching/Filtering

8. User types: "sav" (looking for "Save" option)
9. filter.js calculates on every user keystroke, the string is sent to filter.js
10. fuzzy matching- filter.js compares "Sav" against the list from registry.js , assigns a score to items 
11. updates UI (render.js) - the sorted result from filter are passes to render.js with the help of orchestrator, which updates the visual list the user sees. 

Phase 4: The Execution 

12. User see "Save" highlighted and press Enter.
13. retrieval of action object -
