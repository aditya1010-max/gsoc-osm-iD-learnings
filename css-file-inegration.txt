I have a kbar.css file lying in the css folder of the osm-iD file structure 

at first i thought it would have to be integrated in the css files layers present in css folder 

but i was wrong - kbar needs to have a different css file 

although some kbar components like button can have a global css button property applied to it but rest other components needs to be have seperate css applied to it 

i have to make sure it lies below the last layer of css - it shouldnt override the existing above css files 


Some notes i have collected from me to understand OSM-iD css files better ai ->

1️⃣ First: how iD’s CSS system actually works

Those numbered files you’re seeing are intentional and ordered:

00_reset.css        → normalize / reset
10_colors.css       → color variables
20_map.css          → base map styles
...
80_app.css          → general UI chrome


👉 These are global, foundational layers.
They define shared visual language across the whole editor.

2️⃣ Where does kbar conceptually belong?

Let’s classify kbar:

❌ Not map rendering
❌ Not fills / categories
❌ Not cursors
❌ Not photos
❌ Not generic app chrome (buttons, panels)

✅ It’s a feature-specific UI overlay

That puts it in a different category than those numbered files.

3️⃣ Why kbar.css being separate is actually GOOD
✅ Separation of concerns

kbar.css styles:
only kbar
only the overlay
only its internal UI

Putting that inside 80_app.css would:
mix unrelated concerns
make future refactors harder
make removal harder

Maintainers usually prefer:
“Feature styles live with the feature.”
