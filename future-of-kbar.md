When i first saw the idea of Kbar on OSM-Wiki, i thought to myself it will have to similar to what macbooks command palette. lots of features and commands at one place

But then i realised its not about "more commands" its about how people think inside iD.

when i see the future of kbar: i see it in three terms- short , medium and long.

SHORT TERM -

- basic 3 add actions and 3 edit actions
- kbars value will not be number of commands
- its that it becomes a semantic interface instead of a mechanical one.

the main idea is for-

People stop thinking:
"which shortcut was it?"

and start thinking:
"what do i want to do?"

MEDIUM TERM -

- kbar becomes a learning tool for new mappers
- a bridge between presents, modes and actions

for example-

- add cafe
- draw building
- create road

Internally, these still map to:

- add point
- add area
- preset selection

this alone will massively improves onboading.
