When i first saw the idea of Kbar on OSM-Wiki, i thought to myself it will have to similar to what macbooks command palette looks like. lots of features and commands at one place.

But then i realised its not about "more commands" its about how people think inside iD.

when i see the future of kbar: i see it in three terms- short , medium and long.

SHORT TERM -

- basic 3 add actions and 3 edit actions
- it ensures kbars becomes a semantic interface instead of a mechanical one.

the main idea is for-

People stop thinking:
"which shortcut was it?"

and start thinking:
"what do i want to do?"

MEDIUM TERM -

- kbar becomes a learning tool for new mappers
- a bridge between presents, modes and actions

for example-

- add cafe
- draw building
- create road

Internally, these still map to:

- add point
- add area
- preset selection

this alone will massively improves onboading.

Also i thought of command chaining
example: add road -> tag surface asphalt -> tag lanes 2

i think for power mappers , this will be gold

Kbar will also become search engine for -

- actions
- presets
- modes
- help entries

User will type "roundabout"

It will offer:
. add roundbouts
. tagging help
. existing shortcuts
. wiki reference

This is discovery + action in one place.

LONG TERM (visionary, but realistic)

- Intent-based commands

Instead of precise commands, users type intent:
. fix overlapping buildings
. map this plac
. clean geometry

Kbar will translate intent into action sequence

Acessibility and alternative input

for some users:
. shortcuts are hard
. menus are overwhelming

Kbar will give them:
. keyboard-first access
. screen-reader-friendly workflows
. predictable navigation
