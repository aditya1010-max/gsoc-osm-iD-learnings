When i first saw the idea of Kbar on OSM-Wiki, i thought to myself it will have to similar to what macbooks command palette. lots of features and commands at one place

But then i realised its not about "more commands" its about how people think inside iD.

when i see the future of kbar: i see it in three terms- short , medium and long.

SHORT TERM -

- basic 3 add actions and 3 edit actions
- kbar value will not be number of commands
- its that it becomes a semantic interface instead of a mechanical one.
